# PLLGAN

This is implementation for the methods proposed in paper 'Partial Label Learning via Generative Adversarial Nets'.

Note: PLGAN.py is the main running code.

# Requirements

python == 3.7.1
tensorflow == 1.15.0
scikit-learn == 0.24.0
numpy == 1.16.5
scipy == 1.3.1
tdqm  == 4.36.1

# Datasets

MSRCv2.mat and MSRCv2_indices.mat is data we are the real data sets of the running model we provide.

More real-world PLL datasets are available at http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/
