## PLLGAN

   This is implementation for the methods proposed in paper 'Partial Label Learning via Generative Adversarial Nets'.

            
## Environments

    python == 3.7.1
    tensorflow == 1.15.0
    scikit-learn == 0.24.0
    numpy == 1.16.5
    scipy == 1.3.1
    tdqm  == 4.36.1

## Datasets
   MSRCv2.mat is a real datasets to run this model.
   More UCI and real-world PLL datasets in this paper are available at http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/

## Usage
   PLGAN.py is the main running code.
